Known Issues (PDE devices):

1. On some jukeboxes, after a disconnect, often XNJB will not reconnect unless
   the NJB is disconnected physically and reconnected. XNJB just hangs on 
   'Connecting' (this will timeout eventually with an error). This is caused
   by no data being returned by a usb_bulk_read call. However, data is sent
   correctly as the NJB shows the connected to computer graphic. There must be
   an issue with resetting the usb bus in libusb that is different on Mac OS X
   to Linux (I have not seen this problem on Linux). This behaviour is shown
   on my NJB3 but the NJB1 and Micro very rarely need a hard disconnect.

2. XNJB might fail with an error like 'usb_set_configuration: No such file or
   directory'.  Don't know what causes it but it appears as though a restart
   fixes it.

Known Issues (MTP devices):

1. Can't get or set the date/time of the device.

2. XNJB does not read in album art with iTunes Integration enabled.  Does anyone know
   how to get album art from iTunes?

3. Some devices are dual mode MTP and UMS/MSC.  The UMS code on OS X is broken (as of
   approximately 10.4.8) so fails to mount your player.  However, it will grab it
   so XNJB cannot connect.  The only way of getting round this that I know of is
   to disable the UMS driver so you cannot mount any UMS devices (USB keys, cameras,
   etc.).  If you think you have this problem, get the debug version of XNJB and run
   in the console.  You will see error messages similar to this if you have this problem:

Device 1 (VID=0781 and PID=7460) is a SanDisk Sansa Express.
usb_os_open: 0781:7460
usb_claim_interface: called for interface 0
Interface 0 of device is 0x4f83
claim_interface: Interface 0 of device from QueryInterface is 0x3c7200
USB error: claim_interface(USBInterfaceOpen): another process has device opened for exclusive access
USB error: usb_claim_interface: couldn't claim interface
usb_claim_interface(): Undefined error: 0
LIBMTP PANIC: Unable to initialize device 1
LIBMTP PANIC: configure_usb_devices() error code: 7 on line 1561
LIBMTP_Get_First_Device: Error Connecting 

  The key thing to look out for is 'another process has device opened for exclusive access'.
  If you have this problem then the following workaround should help.  It's fully reversible but
  does require a restart.  As with all of XNJB, this is at your own risk.

    1. Open up a terminal window
    2. Type:

sudo mv /System/Library/Extensions/IOUSBMassStorageClass.kext /System/Library/Extensions/IOUSBMassStorageClass.kext.disabled

and when prompted enter your password.

    3. Restart.

  To reverse this change, just reverse the filenames:

sudo mv /System/Library/Extensions/IOUSBMassStorageClass.kext.disabled /System/Library/Extensions/IOUSBMassStorageClass.kext

  and restart.
